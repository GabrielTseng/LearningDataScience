## DB4: Relational Algebra

The statement of accomplishment can be viewed [here](DB4_Statement.pdf)

The exercises consisted of executing the query (described in words in a comment on the top of each file,
for instance `\\ Find all pizzerias that serve every pizza eaten by people over 30.` in `q9`).

The language used to write the queries is [`radb`](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~junyang/radb/)

All queries are on the [`pizza.sql`](pizza.sql) data.
