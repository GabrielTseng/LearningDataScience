## Using scikit-learn to find bullies

[Link to blogpost](https://medium.com/@gabrieltseng/using-scikit-learn-to-find-bullies-c47a1045d92f) where I explain in more detail my approach. 

In this folder, I tackle Kaggle's (very old) [Detecting Insults in Social Commentary](https://www.kaggle.com/c/detecting-insults-in-social-commentary) challenge. 

Using Word Embeddings, I better the AUC ROC score from 0.84 to 0.89.
